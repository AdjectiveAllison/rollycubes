- [ ] move UI elements depending where dice land
- [ ] fix the z indexing on everything
- [ ] raise wall as soon as dice cross the plane
- [ ] maybe higher walls in general
- [ ] moveable dice? or transparency, some escape hatch
- [ ] shake to roll?

nice to have:
- [ ] refactor all the code so it's not bad
